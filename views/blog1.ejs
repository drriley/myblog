						<h1>Achieving Greatness Through Our Habits</h1>
							<p><h3>We Are What We Do</h3>
							“We are what we repeatedly do”, was stated by the world-renowned western philosopher Aristotle. When I first read this quote I began to ask myself if everything that I do actually reflects who I am; for example, I enjoy reading about philosophy and human behavior, does that mean I am a philosopher or thinker? I also enjoy scrolling mindlessly through Instagram for probably hours in a day, does this make me a social media junkie? As I kept going down the list of things do and do not perform, I began realize Aristotle was absolutely correct. I am in fact defined by the things that I do or do not perform. Rather we want to lie to ourselves about who we are or not, reflecting on what we do will bring us to the conclusion of who we are. Well that is pretty simple and obvious observation right? However as I began to really ponder on the word ‘repeatedly’, I begin to realize a deeper truth. We are even more so defined by the actions that we do most often in given day. What are these repeated actions? Yes of course, habits. Our habits control us, make us do things we may not fully agree with, and most of all define who we actually are. We all have good and bad habits. So how can we make sure our habits work for us?  So in this post I want to see if we can use the power of habits to actually improve our lives and reach greater achievements. 
							</p>
							
												<p><h3>Understanding The Nature of Habits</h3>
											In order to harness our habits for our positive lives, we must first understand how this source works. <u>The Power of Habit</u> by Charles Duhigg’s, does a great job explaining some of the psychological research behind our habits. The books starts with a study of an elder man who has suffered from brain damage. The man struggled to remember his family, the nurses in the hospital, and any task he would complete just moments ago. However, there something special about this patient. The man remembered when to brush his teeth effortlessly and could take specific walks around his neighborhood without getting lost. This was trivial to researchers, why is that some mental task came easy to the gentleman and some seemed impossible for him? Well after a couple brain experiments with lab rats (of course), they found the source of habits. It comes to this, your brain makes decisions to do various tasks based on the reward it receives from performing the action and  compares it to the cost or effort it takes to complete it. When your brain continuously receives an satisfying award from a particular task you perform often, your brain actually uses less mental energy when deciding to perform the given task. 
												</p>
												
												
													<p><h3>What do habits do in our daily life?
													</h3>
													So we now understand that our daily actions and the rewards receive for those actions become increasingly easier for us as we repeatedly perform these activities; therefore the rewards we crave and their benefits become easier to obtain.You can now see how bad habits or addictions can plague us so easily. Its already easy for you to get that 6-pack from the store or perhaps that last cupcake from the pantry before you sleep. Now with tasks such as these that come so effortlessly, imagine how even more effortlessly our brains make decisions due to this mental law of habits. The habit just keeps getting stronger and it becomes increasingly difficult to avoid. This seems threatening when you think of it in that particular manner. However, what if we can control the effects and focus it on ways make positive habits, thus improving our daily lives. It is my belief that we can actually use these natural behaviors to perform actions that we truly desire. In <u>The Power of Habits</u> they depict a diagram called the habit loop, that visually shows the habit system.

						<p><h3>The Habit Loop</h3>It is my belief that we can actually use these natural behaviors to perform actions that we truly desire. In the Power of Habit the author depicts a diagram called the habit loop, that visually shows the habit system.</p><img src="/bootflat/img/habitloop.png">
						<p><h3>1. The Cue</h3> This is the loop initiator this is something that reminds us of the reward we can receive. This can be as simple as passing by the Golden Arches from McDonalds or seeing last night’s beer can on the table. The Cue is important because this can be seen as the sensitive trigger that if pressured can fire actions uncontrollably to receive a reward craving.  </p>
						
						<p><h3>2. The Action</h3> This is where you actually perform to the task to receive the reward. For example studying late at night  for that Midterm to hopefully results in an improved GPA. This is where if used correctly can help you perform tasks that seem difficult to start, which we will discuss later in creating habit strategies.
						  </p>
						
						
						<p><h3>3. The Reward</h3> This is the end goal of whatever action you committed. This is where the brain, if satisfied enough by the reward, will perform the task with a little less energy than before. Be cautious rewards are simply stimulations or feelings, and there are both harmful and beneficial stimulations in the world. So be observant of the rewards you crave and their effects on your wellbeing.
						
						  </p>
						
						
							<p><h3>Mastering the Loop</h3> So how can we use this habit formula to get us in the position of life that we desire? Imagine getting up in the morning and making effortless decisions, where deciding to go to the gym seemed as easy as brushing your teeth in the morning. We all have images of ourselves and who we would like to be in life. However, usually what we want to become is usually more difficult than what you already are. Hence why we are who we are and not who we desire to be. I believe that if we want to master ourselves and become the best we can be, then we must trick this loop into working for us instead of against us. 
							
							  </p>
													
							<p><h3>How hard can it be?</h3> It is my belief that in order to master this loop we must focus on the reward. If we can train ourselves to only reward ourselves after we complete a desired task, we can more easily accomplish what we truly desire. Now of course the hard part is rewarding yourself with things you probably can obtain without a particular task interfering; for example, doing your homework before enjoying a Instagram scrolling session for 20 minutes. So if you could master your craving for rewards, scientifically you can make it easier on yourself to start difficult task. So in my case, I want to write a business plan, however its difficult to really see the reward in making a business plan. It’s actually debatable if I will ever see an reward from performing such a task. So I must find a reward I enjoy, for instance I enjoy playing the video game NBA 2k. So if I can control my urge to play and only play after I do an hour of my business plan, I will begin forming a habit. Then once that hour of working on my business plan has become easier for me, then maybe I will try and increase my work effort to an hour and half. This ongoing completion of tasks resulting in rewards will begin to train my brain into an habit loop. Which if done often enough I would be able to start and complete the task with less mental effort. Lastly, we must pay close attention to our Cues. They are the spark to the our reward craving brains, so its important to recognize what cues drive you to seek particular rewards. Once you recognize that cue use it to your advantage, either by avoiding it or seeking it, depending on if you want to perform a desired task or not. Next are a few steps that can potentially help you develop strategies for life changing habits.

									<p><h3>Taking Action</h3> 
										<h4>1. Observe your rewards</h4>
										Take a moment and take of list of all the rewarding activities you enjoy in a day. Also try and recognize what cues drive you to seek such rewards. Honestly rank these activities by level of enjoyment. Also try your best to seek rewards that are not harmful or will prevent you from becoming the person you want to be. This also can be a very good self reflecting experience. 
										
										<h4>2. Start with a small task</h4>
										Find an easy productive task that you wish you did more often. This can be as simple as making your bed. Find one and make a note of it. Also make sure it can be adequately accomplished with the right level of reward at the end. So maybe you enjoy eating chocolate, but that chocolate may not have a strong enough satisfaction to motivate you to run 3 miles a day. So find this task and depending on the difficulty match a reward that can satisfy it.
										
										<h4>3. Putting it all together</h4>
										Using your rewards and cues try and position your task in between the two, just as seen in the habit loop above. It is important that you are confident in the timing of your cue because it can  weaken the effectiveness of your strategy. For example, if you happen to eat your pint of Ben & Jerry’s ice cream at 7pm, try recognizing that and find tasks that best fit a 6pm-7pm timeframe. Use these 3 steps to help you strategize your different loops and make habits that work for you. By sticking to the process, you will slowly see yourself changing with new habits. Even simply reflecting on your habits during your day, you will become more cautious of where your time and energy is going.

										<p><h3>Thank you for tuning in</h3> I really appreciate you for taking the time and reading my first blog post. I know that doing a task and rewarding yourself may seem like a very simple and trivial idea; however, I realized more often than not, the simplest things in life often hold some the greatest benefits for us. Leave comments and lets take the opportunity to learn from one another. Also you can <a href="/">subscribe here</a> for future post updates. Lastly, I would like to leave you with a more completed version of the quote from the beginning of the article.
